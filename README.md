# PCB Designs

A collection of printed circuit board (PCB) designs for various projects.

## Overview

This repository contains PCB design files, schematics, and documentation for custom electronic circuits.

## PCB Process:
1. Place components
2. Create board outline (Edge.Cuts)
3. Export DSN to Freerouting
4. Autoroute in Freerouting
5. Import SES file back to KiCad
6. THEN add copper pours (last step!)
7. Fill zones (B key)
8. Add vias for ground plane stitching
9. Run final DRC

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) - Open source EDA software

### Manufacturing
- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
